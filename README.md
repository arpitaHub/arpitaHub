## Hey, I'm Arpita 👋

I'm a BCA student with a deep interest in cybersecurity and a love for frontend web development. Right now, I'm currently working on two projects that are really close to my heart:

- 🤖 An AI-based Spam & Phishing Filter  
- ✍️ Alfaazly – a space where I share shayari based on life experiences

I'm someone who enjoys learning new things and exploring how technology works. Web designing is something I already know, and now I’m slowly moving towards the world of ethical hacking and security.

### 🛠️ Tech I’m familiar with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python
- Git & GitHub

### 🗂️ 2025 Goals:
- Build a strong base in cybersecurity  
- Complete real-world projects  
- Start contributing to open-source  
- Keep growing and learning, one step at a time

> *"Allegro: Living with zest."* — I try to keep this energy in everything I do.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! 😊
